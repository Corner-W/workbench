# Karabiner Config

This is my personal [Karabiner](//github.com/tekezo/Karabiner-Elements)
configuration, which maps Caps lock to F13 (Shift-F1) as tmux prefix, as well
as other very personal stuff.

NOTE: Disable Caps Lock (System Preferences > Keyboard > Modifier Keys...)
as suggested by Karabiner.
